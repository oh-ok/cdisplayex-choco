# Chocolatey Package: CDisplayEX
This is the source code for the CDisplayEx Chocolatey Package. 
https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/cdisplayex/

Note: I am not affiliated with CDisplayEx, Prodigy Software S.A.R.L. or Henri Gourvest. I am simply someone who uses both CDisplayEx and Chocolatey on a regular basis and noticed that it was missing in the community repository. 

I will try my best to keep this repository up-to-date, however you will always be able to download the latest and greatest version of the software at https://cdisplayex.com/downloads/
